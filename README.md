# Practice JavaScript Functions, Conditional Statements and Arrays!

If you are interested in getting some extra practice, feel free to clone the repository and solve as many questions as you can in the 'test.js' file.

## Instructions:

1. Make sure to fork the repository so that you can push your local changes online.
2. If your goal isn't to display how you've solved the problems on your repository, feel free to just clone and download locally but you are not required to submit a pull request for this repository as I want this repo to remain unanswered for future contenders as well.
3. Remember to have fun, and if you get stuck on anything, I recommend taking a break or coming back at a later time. This isn't a race, it's a journey.

### Updates:

At the current time, there are no tests to check your own results.
